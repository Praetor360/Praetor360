- 👀 I’m interested in Python and SQL for now from a coding perspective, currently I am a tech and would like to migrate into data science or engineering...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, from scratch as I have no coding experience yet, but hoping to update this as I progress...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I can learn new things...
